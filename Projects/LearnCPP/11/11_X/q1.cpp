Question #1

Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health potions, torches, and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and an std::array to store the number of each item the player is carrying (the enumerators are used as indexes of the array). The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total. Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.

// Create an enum to identify the different types of items
enum Items {
    healthPotions,
    torches,
    arrows,

// Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total.
int countTotalItems(const std::array<int, 3>& player) {
    return std::reduce(player.begin(), player.end());
}


int main() {
    // an std::array to store the number of each item the player is carrying (the enumerators are used as indexes of the array)
    // The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows.
    std::array playerItems {2, 5, 10};

    // Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems()
    std::cout << "Total number of items: " << countTotalItems(playerItems) << '\n';
    
    // as well as the number of torches.
    std::cout << "Total number of torches: " << playerItems[Items::torches];
