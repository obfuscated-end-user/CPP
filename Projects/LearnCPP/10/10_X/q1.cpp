Question #1

In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters. Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that can be one of the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for this.

Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string or std::string_view), as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take before they die. Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().

Your program should produce the following output:

This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

enum monsterType {
    ogre,
    dragon,
    orc,
    giantSpider,
    slime,
};

struct Monster {
    monsterType type {};
    std::string name {};
    double health {1};
};

void printMonster(const Monster& monster) {
    std::string type {};
    switch(monster.type) {
        case ogre: type = "Ogre"; break;
        case dragon: type = "Dragon"; break;
        case orc: type = "Orc"; break;
        case giantSpider: type = "Giant Spider"; break;
        case slime: type = "Slime"; break;
        default: type = "???"; break;
    }
    std::cout << "This " << type << " is named " << monster.name << " and has " << monster.health << " health.\n";
}

int main() {
    Monster Ogre { ogre, "Torg", 145};
    Monster Slime { slime, "Blurp", 23};

    printMonster(Ogre);
    printMonster(Slime);

    return 0;
