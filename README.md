# C++

## Introduction
This repository contains C++ code.  
Self-study kind of thing.  

Also, only do this when you're mentally sound. Failure to meet that will yield you nothing. Can you guess why there are astronomically huge gaps on the dates in some of the folder names?

## Things to do
1. Scrape websites
2. Make a game, doesn't matter if it's bad
3. Make a Discord bot
4. Learn assembly
5. Write more code and get off tutorial hell

## Useful links
Always remember that there are WAY more options out there on the web, and you shouldn't restrict yourself in like, one source, or whatever. If you find one of these links here to be of embarrassingly shoddy quality, you can just skip it and move on. I may remove some of these in the near future, when judgment hits me back to reason, and stuff. That doesn't make any sense. I don't know anymore.
