# C++ stuff

## Introduction
This repository contains code that I wrote for learning C++. The code quality itself is shit, so don't expect anything from it. Feel free to look and laugh at my shitty programming skills.

## Other

## Things to do(?)
1. Scrape shit off websites
2. Make a game, doesn't matter if it's crap
3. Make a Discord bot just to fuck with people
4. Learn assembly
5. Write more code and get off tutorial hell
