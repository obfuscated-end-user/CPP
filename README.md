## read this shit obviously

## you're at 11.17
## WHAT THE FUCK FIX YOUR COMPILER

## quizzes to do:
11.9

if multiple files:
CTRL + SHIFT + B TO BUILD YOUR FUCKING TASK
if single file:
RIGHT CLICK AND RUN YOUR SHIT AS USUAL OR CTRL + ALT + N
you can also use either if for some reason one method doesn't work

delete all .exe files after you finish your lesson
copy everything in boilerplate.cpp for a reusable template

if you want to use multiple files in your project:
#include "filename.cpp"

file hierarchy should be like this:
LearnCPP
    chapter #
        #_#X    - folder containing things related to that lesson
        #_#.cpp
        #_X.cpp - for the final exam thing
you don't have to make a cpp file for every lesson
you can also make a folder named after the lesson and work from there (for example, you have something related to multiple files)

NEW FORMAT:
LearnCPP
    chapter #
        #_#
            #_#.cpp
            file.cpp
            whatever.cpp
            (folder that contains some more files if needed)
ex.
LearnCPP
    1
        1_1
        1_2
        1_3
    2
        2_1
        2_2
        2_3
    ...
